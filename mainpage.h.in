 * @section introduction Introduction
 * This package captures NOAAPORT broadcast UDP packets from a DVB-S receiver,
 * creates LDM data-products from the data, and inserts those products into an
 * LDM product-queue. The main components of this package are 1) the \link
 * dvbs_multicast.c \c dvbs_multicast \endlink program; 2) a shared-memory
 * FIFO ; and 3) the \link readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink program.
 * The shared-memory FIFO is used to buffer the flow of data from the \link
 * dvbs_multicast.c \c dvbs_multicast \endlink program to the \link
 * readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink program.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section installation Installation
 * As the LDM user in that user's home directory, get and unpack the
 * distribution:
 * \verbatim
 wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/noaaport/@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.gz
 gunzip -c @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.gz | tar -xf -
\endverbatim
 * Drop into the package directory and build the package using the same options
 * that were used to build the LDM package (which are displayed near the top
 * of the file \c config.log in the top-level LDM source-directory):
 * \verbatim
 cd @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
 ./configure [--disable-max-size] [--disable-root-actions] [CC=...] >configure.log 2>&1
 make install >make.log 2>&1
\endverbatim
 * Unless the option \c --disable-root-actions is given, the \c configure
 * script will ask for the password of the superuser (i.e., \c root) or,
 * failing that, the password of the LDM user (in order to use
 * <tt>sudo(1)</tt>). The reason for this is because each \link dvbs_multicast.c
 * \c dvbs_multicast \endlink process must be owned by \c root in
 * order to lock itself into memory (so that it's not swapped-out by the
 * memory-management system) in order to reduce the risk of missing a broadcast
 * UDP packet. You may choose to not give root's password or the LDM user's
 * password to the \c configure script -- in which case the superuser (root)
 * will have to manually execute the command <tt>make root-actions</tt> after
 * the package has been installed.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section configuration Configuration
 * Edit the LDM configuration file, \c ~/etc/ldmd.conf, and add the entries
 * needed to read and process the DVB-S stream(s).  Here's one possibility:
 *
 * \verbatim
 # DVB-S broadcast UDP listening and shared-memory writing processes
 EXEC    "dvbs_multicast -m 224.0.1.1"
 EXEC    "dvbs_multicast -m 224.0.1.2"
 EXEC    "dvbs_multicast -m 224.0.1.3"
 EXEC    "dvbs_multicast -m 224.0.1.4"

 # Shared-memory reading and data-product creation & insertion processes
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.1"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.2"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.3"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.4"
\endverbatim
 *
 * The \c ldmd.conf actions create a \link dvbs_multicast.c \c
 * dvbs_multicast \endlink process for each available PID from the UDP
 * multicast stream. Each such process places the received packets into a
 * shared-memory buffer for reading by a corresponding \link readnoaaport.c \c
 * readnoaaport \endlink process.  There must be one \link readnoaaport.c \c
 * readnoaaport \endlink process for each \link dvbs_multicast.c \c
 * dvbs_multicast \endlink process.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section logging Logging
 * The \link readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink
 * executable that turns ingested data into IDD products 
 * and injects the products into the LDM queue is written to use the LDM 
 * logging facilities.  The default log file for the LDM is, typically,
 * \c ~/logs/ldmd.log.  We've found it useful to override the
 * default logging and have each instance of
 * \link readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink
 * write a notice of every processed product to its own log file.
 * We do this via the
 * \c -n and \c -u \e X options, where \e X refers to
 * the <tt>local</tt><em>X</em> logging facility:
 *
 * \verbatim
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.1 -n -u 3"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.2 -n -u 4"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.3 -n -u 5"
 EXEC    "readnoaaport -m 224.0.1.4 -n -u 6"
\endverbatim
 *
 * If you are not interested in logging to seperate files, simply omit
 * the \c -u \e X option. The \c -n flag will notify the log of
 * each product
 * that is received, which is useful for monitoring data that is
 * received from the incoming NOAAPORT source. Remove the \c -n
 * argument to
 * \link readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink
 * if you do not want to be notified of every product
 * that is received.
 *
 * Since LDM logging uses \c syslogd(8), one must add additional
 * configuration lines to \c /etc/syslog.conf. 
 * The standard additions to \c /etc/syslog.conf for the LDM are:
 *
 * - Inclusion of \c local0.none in the default system logginf file
 *
 * - Addition of a line that says where to write log messages for log
 *   facility '0'.
 *
 * Here is an example of how this looks on our Fedora Linux system:
 * \verbatim
 *.info;mail.none;news.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;local0.none       /var/log/messages

 # LDM logging
 local0.debug                                                         /home/ldm/logs/ldmd.log
\endverbatim
 *
 * To setup \c syslogd(8) to log to a different file for each ingest script,
 * one has to add more entries to \c /etc/syslog.conf.  Here is an example
 * of how we have \c /etc/syslog.conf setup on our Fedora system
 * that is running the LDM and ingesting the \c nwstg2 and \c oconus streams
 * in the current DVB-S NOAAPORT stream:
 * \verbatim
 *.info;mail.none;news.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;local0.none;local3.none;local4.none;local5.none;local6.none  /var/log/messages

 # LDM logging
 local0.debug                         /home/ldm/logs/ldmd.log

 #
 # LDM NOAAport ingest logging
 #
 local3.debug                         /data/tmp/nwstg.log
 local4.debug                         /data/tmp/goes.log
 local5.debug                         /data/tmp/nwstg2.log
 local6.debug                         /data/tmp/oconus.log
\endverbatim
 *
 * \note
 *
 * - Given the limited number of log facilities, one might be forced
 * to combine logging for more than one DVB-S ingest process.
 *
 * - Modifications to \c /etc/syslog.conf must be done as \c root.
 *
 * - While some operating systems do not care what the white space is
 * in \c /etc/syslog.conf, some do.  It is always safest to make sure that
 * white spaces in non-comment lines are tabs.  (Important!).
 *
 * The log files for our NOAAPORT ingest processes can become very large
 * in a hurry.  Because of this, it is best to rotate the files
 * once-per-day.  Here is the \c crontab(1) entry we currently use to do the
 * file rotation:
 * \verbatim
 # rotate NOAAport ingest logs
 0 0 * * * bin/nplog_rotate 4
\endverbatim
 *
 * Here, 4 is the number of days of all DVB-S readnoaaport invocation
 * log files to keep online.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section performance Performance
 * \link dvbs_multicast.c \c dvbs_multicast \endlink
 * is the process which reads the UDP packets from
 * each PID on the multicast. The reading of the UDP stream must be 
 * able to keep up with the stream since there is no mechanism for
 * UDP packets to be retransmitted. We have found that the process which reads
 * these UDP packets can see gaps in the data stream if the process
 * is swapped out by the operating system. To alleviate this possibilty
 * we recommend the following:
 *
 *    - Ensure that the program
 *      \link dvbs_multicast.c \c dvbs_multicast \endlink
 *      is owned by \c root and setuid. This will be done by the installation
 *      process \e if the superuser's password was given to the \c
 *      configure script or the LDM user has \c sudo(1) privileges and
 *      the LDM user's password was given to the \c configure script.
 *      Otherwise, the command <tt>make root-actions</tt> must be executed by
 *      the superuser (i.e., \c root) after the package has been
 *      installed.
 *      This will ensure that the program stays resident in memory and will
 *      not be paged-out.
 *
 *    - Do \e not have each
 *      \link readnoaaport.c \c readnoaaport \endlink
 *      process log every data-product that it processes.
 *
 *    - Consider an LDM product-queue small enough to fit into available
 *      memory to avoiding the need for the system to do lots of paging.
