1.7.0.14 	2011-06-02 11:07:24-06:00
    Moved statistics reporting.  Now in main module.  Reports from both reader
    and product-maker.

    Added 2 GEMPAK tables.

    Reading from file => no thread priority changes
    
    Reduced cyclomatic complexity of noaaportIngester:main().

    Improved "make release" rule: improved extraction of last tag.

1.7.0.13 	2011-05-28 12:20:30-06:00
    Corrected wrap-around handling in FIFO. Both writing and reading.

1.7.0.12 	2011-05-25 15:35:29-06:00
    Corrected "make check-noaaportIngester: had to execute noaaportIngester(1)
    as root.

1.7.0.11 	2011-05-25 15:24:39-06:00
    Added thread priority:
        Both reader and product-maker threads have their scheduler set to
        SCHED-FIFO and their priorities adjusted.  Reader thread's priority is
        higher than product-maker's.

        noaaportIngester(1) is now necessarily installed setuid-root.

1.7.0.10
    Solaris porting.
    
    Reverted __XOPEN_SOURCE__ to 600 in "readnoaaportLog.c" to accomodate
    Solaris, which requires the c99(1) compiler in such cases.

1.7.0.10 	2011-05-24 09:41:14-06:00

    Solaris porting: reverted __XOPEN_SOURCE__ to 600 in "readnoaaportLog.c" to

    in the logging module.

1.7.0.7 	2011-05-18 17:11:44-06:00
    Corrected retrograde packet determination: treat packet number like

1.7.0.3 	2011-05-18 14:27:23-06:00
