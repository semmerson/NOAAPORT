    New "make release" rule.

1.6.1	2011-05-03 15:51:08-06:00
    Corrected use of package and version strings in top-level webpage.

    Improved release procedure.

    Improved portability of build procedure:

1.6.0	2011-05-03 10:35:12-06:00
    Installation:
        Migrated to automake(1)-based installation.

    dvbs_multicast(1):
        Modified to use blocking shmfifo_put().

        Improved information hiding.

        Improved logging:
            Added size of gap to gap log messages.

            Added logging of retrograde packet numbers.
        
            Modified to log correctly while processing command-line arguments.

        Improved portability:
            Added use of HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH so that it can build against
            LDM packages prior to 6.9.

        Reformatted to improve clarity.

    readnoaaport(1):
        Modified to use blocking shmfifo_get().

        Rewrote _shm_bufread() to improve clarity.

        Corrected initialization of "struct shmhandle*".

        Improved information hiding.

        Modified to log correctly while processing command-line arguments.

        Improved portability:
            Added "#define __EXTENSIONS__" so that SunOS 5.10's
            /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc(1) will compile it.

            Added function prototype for "close_pq()".

            Added use of HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH so that it can build against
            LDM packages prior to 6.9.

        Reformatted to improve clarity.

        Added some internal documentation.

    shmfifo(3) module:
        Corrected assignment bug.

        Reworked semaphore signaling. Before, only 1 semaphore was used.
        Now, 3 semaphores are used: one for locking, one as a writer
        condition-variable, and one as a reader condition-variable.

        Improved shmfifo_put():
            Made blocking.

            Made writing to the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

            Added test for invalid size argument and for messages that are
            too big to put into the FIFO.

            Ensured unconditional unlocking of FIFO.

            Added once-per-call logging of insufficient FIFO space.
            
            Reformatted to structured programing.

            Added internal documentation.

        Improved shmfifo_get():
            Made blocking.

            Made reading from the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

            Ensured unconditional unlocking of FIFO.
            
            Reformatted to structured programing.

            Added internal documentation.

        Added shmfifo_wait(), shmfifo_new(), shmfifo_free(), checkLocked() and
        checkUnlocked().

        Reformatted shmfifo_create() to improve clarity.

        Replaced "shmfifo.h" with "shmfifo.hin" and extractDecls(1).

        Added "const" to many places.

    Misc:
        Added README file.
