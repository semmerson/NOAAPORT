1.6.2.9 	2011-05-04 12:25:03-06:00
    Replaced use of file "lastRelease" with "git tag..." in makefile.

1.6.2.8 	2011-05-04 12:17:23-06:00
    Improved updating of file "lastRelease" in makefile.

1.6.2.7 	2011-05-04 12:13:06-06:00
    Modified release-engineering rules in makefile to use file "lastRelease".
    This should allow manual setting of the version string in the file
    "configure.ac", which appears necessary in order to make a public release.

1.6.2.6 	2011-05-04 11:50:03-06:00
    Improved release engineering:
        "make release" now depends on "make releaseCheck".

        Cleaned-up rest of release engineering rules in makefile.

1.6.2.5 	2011-05-04 11:26:46-06:00
    Improved "make release":
        Removed rule for making "configure.ac" from "CHANGE_LOG". This should
        reduce the number of configure(1) invocations.

        Added blank line before previous version in CHANGE_LOG.

1.6.2.4 	2011-05-04 11:20:55-06:00
    Improved "make release": attempt to reduce the number of configure(1)
    invocations by removing the dependency of "make dist" on "configure".

1.6.2.3 	2011-05-04 11:15:25-06:00
    Improved "make release": attempt to reduce the number of configure(1)
    invocations.

1.6.2.2 	2011-05-04 11:06:32-06:00
    Improved "make release"
        Fixed "make timestamp".

        Added "make commitAndTag"

1.6.2.1 	2011-05-04 10:58:53-06:00
    New "make release" rule.

1.6.1	2011-05-03 15:51:08-06:00
    Corrected use of package and version strings in top-level webpage.

    Improved release procedure.

    Improved portability of build procedure:

1.6.0	2011-05-03 10:35:12-06:00
    Installation:
        Migrated to automake(1)-based installation.

    dvbs_multicast(1):
        Modified to use blocking shmfifo_put().

        Improved information hiding.

        Improved logging:
            Added size of gap to gap log messages.

            Added logging of retrograde packet numbers.
        
            Modified to log correctly while processing command-line arguments.

        Improved portability:
            Added use of HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH so that it can build against
            LDM packages prior to 6.9.

        Reformatted to improve clarity.

    readnoaaport(1):
        Modified to use blocking shmfifo_get().

        Rewrote _shm_bufread() to improve clarity.

        Corrected initialization of "struct shmhandle*".

        Improved information hiding.

        Modified to log correctly while processing command-line arguments.

        Improved portability:
            Added "#define __EXTENSIONS__" so that SunOS 5.10's
            /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc(1) will compile it.

            Added function prototype for "close_pq()".

            Added use of HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH so that it can build against
            LDM packages prior to 6.9.

        Reformatted to improve clarity.

        Added some internal documentation.

    shmfifo(3) module:
        Corrected assignment bug.

        Reworked semaphore signaling. Before, only 1 semaphore was used.
        Now, 3 semaphores are used: one for locking, one as a writer
        condition-variable, and one as a reader condition-variable.

        Improved shmfifo_put():
            Made blocking.

            Made writing to the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

            Added test for invalid size argument and for messages that are
            too big to put into the FIFO.

            Ensured unconditional unlocking of FIFO.

            Added once-per-call logging of insufficient FIFO space.
            
            Reformatted to structured programing.

            Added internal documentation.

        Improved shmfifo_get():
            Made blocking.

            Made reading from the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

            Ensured unconditional unlocking of FIFO.
            
            Reformatted to structured programing.

            Added internal documentation.

        Added shmfifo_wait(), shmfifo_new(), shmfifo_free(), checkLocked() and
        checkUnlocked().

        Reformatted shmfifo_create() to improve clarity.

        Replaced "shmfifo.h" with "shmfifo.hin" and extractDecls(1).

        Added "const" to many places.

    Misc:
        Added README file.
