1.5.3.8:
    Migrated to automake(1).

    dvbs_multicast(1):
        Corrected off-by-one packet-number gap values.

        Added logging of retrograde packet numbers.

    shmfifo(3) module:
        Demoted message about finally writing to the shared-memory buffer from
        ERROR to INFO.

1.5.3.7 2011-04-14 14:49
    INSTALL file:
        Removed extraneous comment about commenting-out ULOG_FACILITY_OVERRIDE.
		
        Corrected spelling mistake.

    shmfifo module:
        Corrected assignment bug.

        Improved shmfifo_wait(): made use shmfifo_lock() and 
        shmfifo_unlock().

1.5.3.6 2011-04-12 14:37 
    shmfifo module:
        Split semaphore operation for waiting on a condition-variable
        from 1 to 3 semop(2) calls.

        Added checkLocked() and checkUnlocked().

1.5.3.5 2011-04-12 13:30 
    shmfifo module:
        Reworked semaphore signaling. Before, only 1 semaphore was used.
        Now, 3 semaphores are used: one for locking, one as a writer
        condition-variable, and one as a reader condition-variable.

1.5.3.4 2011-04-08
    Added "const" to many places in the "shmfifo" module.

    Ensured NOTICE and ERROR level messages before calling shmfifo_wait()
    in shmfifo_get() and shmfifo_put(), respectively.

1.5.3.3 2011-04-08
    Improved shmfifo_get(): made blocking and restructured.

    Improved shmfifo_wait(): split the semaphore operations into 2 calls to
    semop(2).

    Improved shmfifo_put(): added missing "break" to shmfifo_wait() loop
    and rewrote loop to improve clarity.

    Modified dvbs_multicast(1) to use blocking shmfifo_get().

    Modified readnoaaport(1): rewrote _shm_bufread() to improve clarity
    and to use blocking shmfifo_get().
        
1.5.3.2 2011-04-07
    Reverted file "readnoaaport.c" to tag "v1.5.2" to see if changes to
    that file are responsible for causing no data-products to be inserted
    into the product-queue. They are, apparently.

1.5.3.1 2011-04-07
    Improved readnoaaport(1):
        Ensured that the FIFO is locked before seeing if it's empty.
        
        Made the reading from the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

        Added some internal documentation.

    Improved shmfifo_put():
        Added test for invalid size argument.

        Reformatted to increase clarity and ensure unconditional unlocking of
        FIFO.

        Added once-per-call logging of insufficient FIFO space.

    Improved shmfifo_wait():
        Added check on whether the current process holds the FIFO lock.

        Added internal documentation regarding the use of the semaphore as a
        condition variable.

    Added internal documentation to shmfifo_get(3).

    Added size of gap to dvbs_multicst(1)'s "gap" message.

1.5.2   2011-04-05
    Modified dvbs_multicast(1) so that it 1) only logs a failure to write to
    the shared-memory FIFO once per UDP packet; and 2) logs a success message
    when a failure finally succeeds.

    Improved dvbs_multicast(1):
        Created static function shmfifo_wait() and modified shmfifo_put(3) to
        use it in a loop until sufficient space is available in the FIFO. This
        will cause each write by dvbs_multicast(1) to block, if necessary,
        until it succeeds -- a much better tactic than polling the
        shared-memory FIFO every 100 microseconds.

        Added test for messages that are too big to put in the FIFO to
        shmfifo_put().

    Corrected spelling in internal documentation.

1.5.1   2010-12-29
    Add commentary in Makefile on user-configurable macros.

    Add editing of Makefile to installation instructions.

1.5.0   2010-12-27
    Adapt to work with LDM 6.9.
