            Modified to log correctly while processing command-line arguments.

        Improved portability:
            Added use of HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH so that it can build against
            LDM packages prior to 6.9.

        Reformatted to improve clarity.

        condition-variable, and one as a reader condition-variable.

        Improved shmfifo_put():
            Made blocking.

            Made writing to the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.
