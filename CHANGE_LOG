1.5.2
    Modified dvbs_multicast(1) so that it 1) only logs a failure to write to
    the shared-memory FIFO once per UDP packet; and 2) logs a success message
    when a failure finally succeeds.

    Improved dvbs_multicast(1). Created static function shmfifo_wait() and
    modified shmfifo_put(3) to use it in a loop until sufficient space is
    available in the FIFO. This will cause each write by dvbs_multicast(1) to
    block, if necessary, until it succeeds -- a much better tactic than polling
    the shared-memory FIFO every 100 microseconds.

    Corrected spelling in internal documentation.
