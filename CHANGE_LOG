1.6.0.8	2011-04-28 10:04:56-06:00
    Corrected "make web-update" rule: corrected symbolic link.

1.6.0.7	2011-04-28 09:56:11-06:00
    Improved "make ftp web-update": added "ensureRelase" as a prerequisite to
    both.

1.6.0.6	2011-04-28 09:47:04-06:00
    Improved "make web-update": added symbolic linking to updated version.

1.6.0.5	2011-04-28 09:10:32-06:00
    Improved "make available": added target "ensureRelease", which skips the
    "make release" actions if a release has already been made.

1.6.0.4	2011-04-27 18:57:07-06:00
    Improved portability of "readnoaaport.c":
        Added "#define __EXTENSIONS__" so that SunOS 5.10's
        /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc(1) will compile it.

        Added function prototype for "close_pq()".

1.6.0.3	2011-04-27 14:29:48-06:00
    Improved portability:
        Removed _XOPEN_SOURCE from "gempak/cfltinq.c";

        Defined HAVE_GET_QUEUE_PATH in "config.h" and modified
        "dvbs_multicast.c" and "readnoaaport.c" to use it.

1.6.0.2	2011-04-27 12:08:58-06:00
        Improved "make release".

1.6.0.1
    Distribution:
        Incremented minor version number due to change in build and install
        mechanism.

        Made "make release" and "make available" different.

        Ignore failure of "make commit" because there might be nothing to
        commit.

1.5.3.10 2011-04-26
    Distribution:
        Renamed "shmfifo.h.in" to "shmfifo.hin".

    configure(1):
        Added check for function "sched_setscheduler()".

        Added setting of environment variable CC before invocation of
        "libpng/configure" so that configure(1) scripts would use the same
        compiler.

1.5.3.9 2011-04-24 15:03
    Distribution:
        Added missing "shmfifo.h.in" to EXTRA_DIST.

        Added AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS to "configure.ac".

1.5.3.8 2011-04-25 13:41
    Building:
        Migrated to automake(1).

    dvbs_multicast(1):
        Corrected off-by-one packet-number gap values.

        Added logging of retrograde packet numbers.

        Hid unnecessarily visible information.

    readnoaaport(1):
        Hid unnecessarily visible information.

    shmfifo(3) module:
        Demoted message about finally writing to the shared-memory buffer from
        ERROR to INFO.

    Installation:
        HTML documentation correctly generated and installed.

    Misc:
        Added README file.

1.5.3.7 2011-04-14 14:49
    INSTALL file:
        Removed extraneous comment about commenting-out ULOG_FACILITY_OVERRIDE.
		
        Corrected spelling mistake.

    shmfifo module:
        Corrected assignment bug.

        Improved shmfifo_wait(): made use shmfifo_lock() and 
        shmfifo_unlock().

1.5.3.6 2011-04-12 14:37 
    shmfifo module:
        Split semaphore operation for waiting on a condition-variable
        from 1 to 3 semop(2) calls.

        Added checkLocked() and checkUnlocked().

1.5.3.5 2011-04-12 13:30 
    shmfifo module:
        Reworked semaphore signaling. Before, only 1 semaphore was used.
        Now, 3 semaphores are used: one for locking, one as a writer
        condition-variable, and one as a reader condition-variable.

1.5.3.4 2011-04-08
    Added "const" to many places in the "shmfifo" module.

    Ensured NOTICE and ERROR level messages before calling shmfifo_wait()
    in shmfifo_get() and shmfifo_put(), respectively.

1.5.3.3 2011-04-08
    Improved shmfifo_get(): made blocking and restructured.

    Improved shmfifo_wait(): split the semaphore operations into 2 calls to
    semop(2).

    Improved shmfifo_put(): added missing "break" to shmfifo_wait() loop
    and rewrote loop to improve clarity.

    Modified dvbs_multicast(1) to use blocking shmfifo_get().

    Modified readnoaaport(1): rewrote _shm_bufread() to improve clarity
    and to use blocking shmfifo_get().
        
1.5.3.2 2011-04-07
    Reverted file "readnoaaport.c" to tag "v1.5.2" to see if changes to
    that file are responsible for causing no data-products to be inserted
    into the product-queue. They are, apparently.

1.5.3.1 2011-04-07
    Improved readnoaaport(1):
        Ensured that the FIFO is locked before seeing if it's empty.
        
        Made the reading from the FIFO event-driven rather than poll-driven.

        Added some internal documentation.

    Improved shmfifo_put():
        Added test for invalid size argument.

        Reformatted to increase clarity and ensure unconditional unlocking of
        FIFO.

        Added once-per-call logging of insufficient FIFO space.

    Improved shmfifo_wait():
        Added check on whether the current process holds the FIFO lock.

        Added internal documentation regarding the use of the semaphore as a
        condition variable.

    Added internal documentation to shmfifo_get(3).

    Added size of gap to dvbs_multicst(1)'s "gap" message.

1.5.2   2011-04-05
    Modified dvbs_multicast(1) so that it 1) only logs a failure to write to
    the shared-memory FIFO once per UDP packet; and 2) logs a success message
    when a failure finally succeeds.

    Improved dvbs_multicast(1):
        Created static function shmfifo_wait() and modified shmfifo_put(3) to
        use it in a loop until sufficient space is available in the FIFO. This
        will cause each write by dvbs_multicast(1) to block, if necessary,
        until it succeeds -- a much better tactic than polling the
        shared-memory FIFO every 100 microseconds.

        Added test for messages that are too big to put in the FIFO to
        shmfifo_put().

    Corrected spelling in internal documentation.

1.5.1   2010-12-29
    Add commentary in Makefile on user-configurable macros.

    Add editing of Makefile to installation instructions.

1.5.0   2010-12-27
    Adapt to work with LDM 6.9.
